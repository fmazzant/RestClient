# Documentation

Use Build() method to create a RestBuilder from Rest

```c#
var rest = Rest.Build();
```

With RestBuilder we can create a simply "Get" call:

```c#
var result = rest
  .Url("[URL]")
  .Get(); 
```

### Certificate Validation

Validation of X.509 certificates is essential to create secure SSL/TLS sessions not vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

The certificate chain validation includes these steps:

* The certificate is issued by its parent Certificate Authority or the root CA trusted by the system.
* Each CA is allowed to issue certificates.
* Each certificate in the chain is not expired.

It's not recommended to reinvent the wheel by implementing custom certificate chain validation.

TLS libraries provide built-in certificate validation functions that should be used.

```c#
var result = rest
    .CertificateValidation((sender, certificate, chain, errors) =>
    {
      // for development, trust all certificates
      if (development) return true; 
      
      // Compliant: trust only some certificates
      return errors == SslPolicyErrors.None 
              && validCerts.Contains(certificate.GetCertHashString()); 
    })
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Get();
```

### Authentication

As defined by HTTP/1.1 [RFC2617], the application should send the access_token directly in the Authorization request header.
You can do so by including the bearer token's access_token value in the HTTP request body as 'Authorization: Bearer {access_token_value}'.

If an authenticated user has a bearer token's access_token or refresh_token that is expired, then a '401 - Unauthorized (invalid or expired refresh token)' error is returned.

```c#
var result = rest
    .OnAuthentication(() => new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", "[Token]"))
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Get();
```

### Refresh Token

A valid bearer token (with active access_token or refresh_token properties) keeps the user's authentication alive without requiring him or her to re-enter their credentials frequently.
The access_token can be used for as long as itâ€™s active, which is up to one hour after login or renewal. The refresh_token is active for 336 hours (14 days). After the access_token expires, an active refresh_token can be used to get a new access_token / refresh_token pair as shown in the following example. This cycle can continue for up to 90 days after which the user must log in again. If the refresh_token expires, the tokens cannot be renewed and the user must log in again.

To refresh a token, use "RefreshTokenInvoke" automatically.

```c#
var url = "[URL]";
var result = rest
    .OnAuthentication(() => new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", "[Token]"))
    .RefreshToken(true)
    .RefreshTokenInvoke(async () =>
    {
        var result = await rest
            .Url(url)
            .Command("/refresh")
            .GetAsync<TokenObjectResponse>();   
        doSomethings(); //store the token inside your env.
        return result;
    })
    .Command("/detail")
    .Url(url)
    .Get();
```

A refresh_token should be revoked:
* If a user is no longer permitted to make requests on the API, or
* If the access_token or refresh_token have been compromised.

### Network Credential

The NetworkCredential class is a base class that supplies credentials in password-based authentication schemes such as basic, digest, NTLM, and Kerberos. 
Classes that implement the ICredentials interface, such as the CredentialCache class, return NetworkCredential objects.
This class does not support public key-based authentication methods such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) client authentication.

```c#
var result = rest
    .NetworkCredential("myUsername","myPassword")
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Get();
```

```c#
var result = rest
    .NetworkCredential(() =>  new System.Net.NetworkCredential("myUsername","myPassword"))
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Get();
```

### Headers

The Headers collection contains the protocol headers associated with the request. The .Header((h)=>{}) method allows to add the list of key.

```c#
var result = rest
    .Header((h) => {
        if(!h.Contains("auth-custom"))
            h.Add("auth-custom", "value");
    })
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Get();
```

### Serialization

Two types of serialization that are supported by RestClient: Xml and Json, but it is possible implemetate ISerializerContent to customize the serialization.
RestClient uses .Json() to serialize an object into json.

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Json()
    .Get<MyObject>();
```

RestClient uses .Xml() to serialize an object into xml.

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Xml()
    .Get<MyObject>();
```

### Custom Serialization

Consider the code below to demonstrate custom Serialization by implementing the ISerializerContent interface:

```c#
public class MyCustomSerializer : ISerializerContent
{
    public string MediaTypeAsString => throw new NotImplementedException();

    public object DeserializeObject(string value, Type typeOf)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    public string SerializeObject(object value, Type typeOf)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```
Now, we can use MyCustomSerializer how to explan the code below:

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .CustomSerializer(new MyCustomSerializer { })
    .Get<MyObject>();
```

### Get

GET is used to request data from a specified resource and GET is one of the most common HTTP methods.

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Get();

var result = await rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .GetAsync();
```

Some other notes on GET requests:

* GET requests can be cached
* GET requests remain in the browser history
* GET requests can be bookmarked
* GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
* GET requests have length restrictions
* GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)

Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request:

### Parameters as query string 

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Command("/path")
    .Parameter("id","10")
    .Parameter("type", "myType")
    .Get(); // [URL]/path?id=10&type=myTYpe

```

### Post

POST is used to send data to a server for create/update a resource.
The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request payload of the HTTP request:

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Payload(new Object{})
    .Post<ResponseObject>();

var result = await rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Payload(new Object{})
    .PostAsync<ResponseObject>();
```
POST is one of the most common HTTP methods.

Some other notes on POST requests:

* POST requests are never cached
* POST requests do not remain in the browser history
* POST requests cannot be bookmarked
* POST requests have no restrictions on data length

### Put

PUT is used to send data to a server for create/update a resource.

The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Payload(new Object{})
    .Put<ResponseObject>();

var result = await rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Payload(new Object{})
    .PutAsync<ResponseObject>();
```

### Delete

The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Payload(new Object{})
    .Delete<ResponseObject>();

var result = await rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Payload(new Object{})
    .DeleteAsync<ResponseObject>();
```

### Payload

A payload is the carrying capacity of a packet or other transmission data unit. RestClient uses .Playload<T>(obj) to set an object on request. 

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Payload(new RequestObject{})
    .Post<ResponseObject>();
```

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Payload(new RequestObject{})
    .Put<ResponseObject>();
```

### OnUploadProgress

OnUploadProgress occurs when the request is running and the data is traveling outside. It is allow todo somethings, get a percentage of upload for example.

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .OnUploadProgress(p =>
    {
      DoSomethings(p.ProgressPercentage); 
    }) //occurs during request
    .Payload(new BigObject{})
    .Post<ResponseObject>();
```

### OnDownloadProgress

OnDownloadProgress occurs when the response is running and the data is traveling inside.  It is allow todo somethings, get a percentage of download for example.

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .OnDownloadProgress(p =>
    {
      DoSomethings(p.ProgressPercentage); 
    }) //occurs during response
    .Payload(new BigObject{})
    .Post<ResponseObject>();
```

### Timeout

The default value is 100,000 milliseconds (100 seconds).
To set an infinite timeout, set the property value to InfiniteTimeSpan.
A Domain Name System (DNS) query may take up to 15 seconds to return or time out. If your request contains a host name that requires resolution and you set Timeout to a value less than 15 seconds, it may take 15 seconds or more before an Exception is thrown to indicate a timeout on your request.

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Timeout(3200) //milliseconds
    .Get<ResponseObject>();
```

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .Timeout(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10)) 
    .Get<ResponseObject>();
```

### OnStart

OnStart occurs when the request is starting and it is allow todo somethings. 
Cancelling request for example.

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .OnStart((e) => { 
        DoSomethings(e); 
    })
    .Payload(new BigObject{})
    .Post<ResponseObject>();
```
### OnPreResult

OnPreResult occurs when the request is completing but the request is not completed. 
When OnPreResult is raises we can todo somethings, for example  get and use the result of request.

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .OnPreResult((e) => { 
        DoSomethings(e); 
    })
    .Payload(new BigObject{})
    .Post<ResponseObject>();
```

### OnCompleted

OnCompleted occurs when the request is completed. 

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .OnCompleted((e) => { 
        DoSomethings(e); 
    })
    .Payload(new BigObject{})
    .Post<ResponseObject>();
```

### OnException

OnException occurs when the request raises an exception. 

```c#
var result = rest
    .Url("[URL]")
    .OnException((e) => { 
      DoSomethings(e); 
    })
    .Payload(new BigObject{})
    .Post<ResponseObject>();
```

### Complete code example

Consider the code below to demonstrate a complete code example. RestClient allows to create a flexible and robust network layer and it is very easy to use.

```c#

    //building context

    public RestBuilder Root() 
        => Rest.Build()
            .CertificateValidation((sender, certificate, chain, errors) =>
            {
              if (development) return true; 
              return errors == SslPolicyErrors.None 
                      && validCerts.Contains(certificate.GetCertHashString()); 
            })
            .Url("[URL]");
    
    public RestBuilder RootAuthentication() 
        => Root()
             .OnAuthentication(() => new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", "[Token]"))
             .RefreshToken()
             .RefreshTokenInvoke(async () => await Refresh(new RefreshRequest { }));
    
    public RestBuilder UsersRoot() 
        => Root().Command("/Users");
    
    public RestBuilder DimensionsRoot() 
        => Root().Command("/Dimensions");
    
    public RestBuilder EventsRoot()
        => RootAuthentication().Command("/Events");
    
    //requests

    public async Task<RestResult<LoginResponse>> Login(LoginRequest request) 
        => await UsersRoot()
            .Command("/Login") //[URL]/Users/Login 
            .Payload(request)
            .PostAsync<LoginResponse>();
    
    public async Task<RestResult<RefreshResponse>> Refresh(RefreshRequest request) 
        => await UsersRoot()
            .Command("/Refresh")
            .Payload(request)
            .PostAsync<RefreshResponse>();
    
    public async Task<RestResult<CountryResponse>> Countries(CountryRequest request) 
        => await DimensionsRoot()
            .Command("/Countries")
            .Payload(request)
            .PostAsync<CountryResponse>();
    
    public async Task<RestResult<EventDetailResponse>> EventDetail(EventDetailRequest request) 
        => await EventsRoot()
            .Command("/EventDetail")
            .Payload(request)
            .PostAsync<EventDetailResponse>();
```
